"""Seed improvement procedure, revised in generation 2.

The procedure is part of the agent: it may rewrite solver.py AND this file.
An accepted rewrite of this file governs every later generation.

CONTRACT (enforced by the harness)
  improve(ctx, api) -> {"files": {"solver.py": str, "improver.py": str}, "note": str}
      Omit a file (or return None) to keep it unchanged.
  ctx: {"generation", "results": [{"id", "passed", "examples", "failure"}], "memory", "budget"}
      results are the current solver's results on the development tasks.
  api.llm(prompt=None, *, messages=None, system=None, max_tokens=None) -> str
  api.source(name) -> str      the agent's own current source ("solver.py" or "improver.py")
  api.trial(solver_source, n) -> {"solved", "n"}   quick trial on n development tasks
  api.budget() -> remaining {"llm_calls", "output_tokens", "trial_tasks"}
  Standard library only. No file, network or process access.

The harness, not this procedure, decides whether a rewrite is kept: the new
solver must solve more development tasks than the current one, and the
rewrite must include a changed improver.py.
